The nightly-only [`concat_idents!`] macro in the Rust standard library is
notoriously underpowered in that its concatenated identifiers can only refer to
existing items, they can never be used to define something new.

[`concat_idents!`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.concat_idents.html

This crate provides a more flexible spin on concatenating idents.

```toml
[dependencies]
mashup = "0.1"
```

Mashup works with any Rust compiler version 1.15+.

## So tell me about concatenating idents

This crate provides a `mashup!` macro-generating macro. You provide mashup a
mapping of arbitrary key tokens to idents that you want concatenated together,
and mashup defines for you a substitution macro that substitutes your key tokens
with the single concatenated ident corresponding to each one.

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate mashup;

// Use mashup to generate a substitution macro called m. The substitution macro
// will replace all occurrences of the key token "method" in its input with the
// single concatenated identifier abc.
mashup! {
    m["method"] = a b c;
}

struct Struct;

m! {
    impl Struct {
        fn "method"() {}
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Our struct now has an abc method.
    Struct::abc();
}
```

## Glossary

- **Substitution macro:** A macro produced by the `mashup!` macro. The input to
  `mashup!` provides a name for one or more substitution macros to be defined.
  The substitution macro in the short example above is called `m!`.

- **Key tokens:** Arbitrary tokens that are to be replaced by a single
  concatenated ident anywhere in the input of a substitution macro. The token
  `"method"` is used as a key token above.

- **Ident pieces:** Idents that are concatenated together to form a single
  concatenated ident in the final macro-expanded code. The `a` `b` `c` are ident
  pieces that come together to form the `abc` method name.

## More elaborate example

This example demonstrates some trickier uses of mashup.

- You may need to bundle a `mashup!` invocation inside of a more convenient
  user-facing macro of your own.

- The `mashup!` invocation may define multiple substitutions, including via the
  `$(...)*` repetition available in macro\_rules.

- Key tokens may consist of more than one token.

- Substitution macros work equally well in item position and expression
  position.

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate mashup;

const ROCKET_A: &str = "/a";
const ROCKET_B: &str = "/b";

macro_rules! routes {
    ($($route:ident),*) => {{
        mashup! {
            $(
                m["rocket-codegen-route" $route] = ROCKET_ $route;
            )*
        }

        m! {
            vec![$("rocket-codegen-route" $route),*]
        }
    }}
}

fn main() {
    let routes = routes!(A, B);
    assert_eq!(routes, vec!["/a", "/b"]);
}
```

## Attributes

Attributes for the substitution macro, including doc comments, may be provided
inside of the mashup invocation.

```rust
mashup! {
    /// Needs better documentation.
    #[macro_export]
    m1["w"] = W w;
    m1["x"] = X x;

    #[macro_export]
    #[doc(hidden)]
    m2["y"] = Y y;
    m2["z"] = Z z;
}
```

## Limitations

- The `mashup!` macro may be invoked *at most once* within a lexical scope. To
  provide a way around this, you may use a single mashup invocation to define
  more than one substitution macro by using as many different substitution macro
  names within one invocation as you want ([#5]).

- As a consequence of hygiene, a concatenated identifier may not be used to
  refer to a captured local variable ([#6]).
